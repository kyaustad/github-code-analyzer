# GitHub Code Analyzer
 
A fully automated GitHub repository analyzer that counts lines of code across all your repositories and updates stats dynamically. Runs on the default branch of each repo and skips forks.

*Stats update automatically via GitHub Actions.*
 
## How It Works  
This GitHub Action automatically fetches all your public repositories (excluding forks), clones the **default branch**, and analyzes lines of code using [`cloc`](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc). It then updates the repository’s `README.md` with the latest code statistics. The workflow runs **by default every Sunday at midnight UTC (customizable)**, keeping your stats up to date.

## Usage

### **Setting Up the GitHub Action**
1. **Add the Workflow File**  
   Copy the `analyze-code.yml` file into your repository at:
   ```
   .github/workflows/analyze-code.yml
   ```
   Then commit and push the changes.

   *Make sure to update the workflow file with your GitHub username wherever required.*

2. **Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**  
   You need a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** with **`repo`** permissions.  
   Refer to [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/settings/tokens) on how to generate one.

3. **Add the Token to Repository Secrets**  
   - Go to **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**  
   - Name the secret **`GH_PAT`**  
   - Paste the generated token and save.

4. **Update Workflow Permissions**  
   In the repository where you're running the action, make sure to update workflow permissions:
   - Go to **Settings → Actions → General**.
   - Under **Workflow permissions**, select **"Read and write permissions"**.
   - This allows the workflow to update files like `README.md` automatically.

5. **Trigger the Workflow**
   - The workflow runs **by default every Sunday at midnight UTC (customizable)**.
   - To **run manually**, go to **GitHub Actions → Select Workflow → Run Workflow**.
   - To **run on every push**, modify the workflow's `on:` section to:
     ```yaml
     on:
       push:
         branches:
           - main
     ```
   
6. **Wait for Processing**  
   The time taken depends on the number of repositories and their sizes. Once completed, your `README.md` will be updated with the latest **lines of code breakdown**.

7. **Ensure Placeholders Are Present**  
   To allow automatic updates, your `README.md` must include the following placeholders:
   ```
    <!-- LANGUAGES BREAKDOWN (STATIC EXAMPLE) START -->

    <!-- LANGUAGES BREAKDOWN (STATIC EXAMPLE) END -->
   ```
   The workflow will update the stats between these markers.  
   *Remove `(STATIC EXAMPLE)` when adding it in your README, as it's just a placeholder. It's included here only to prevent automatic updates in this README.*

### **Configure Language Detection**
By default, the workflow excludes some file types from counting:
```bash
cloc . --exclude-ext=json,html,css,svg,md,py,ps1,scss --json > ../output/cloc-output.json
```
You can modify this list in the workflow file to include or exclude specific languages based on your needs.

After execution, you can check the **`cloc-output.json`** file inside the `output` folder to see the full language breakdown.  
For a complete list of supported languages, refer to [`cloc` documentation](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).


## Upcoming Features

Soon, I'll be pushing changes to configure workflow execution based on a JSON configuration.  
This will allow you to:
- Specify **which repositories** the script should run on by default.
- Define **whether to run on all branches** or only specific branches for certain repositories.

This feature will be updated shortly.
